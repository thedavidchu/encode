# Wordle Helper

This does not solve the Wordle for you. Rather, it is a tool the user can interact with to help.


## Dictionary

The dictionary can be substituted for any dictionary on new-line delimited words. I'm not sure where I got the one in this directory from, but a quick google search came up with possible matches:

* https://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt (referred by reddit, but the website didn't load for me. It would make sense because it advirtises 58k words and that's how many words are in my dictionary).
